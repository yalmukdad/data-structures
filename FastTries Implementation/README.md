# FastTries Implementation

This project implements a FastTries data structure in Java. FastTries are an array-based approach to storing and searching for integers and their associated values. They use binary search for efficient lookups.

## Files

*   `FastTries.java`: Contains the implementation of the `FastTries` class.
*   `M06A12.java`: A tester file to validate the `FastTries` implementation.

## Usage

1.  Compile both Java files.
2.  Run the `M06A12.java` file to see the test results.

## Features

*   Insertion of key-value pairs
*   Search for values by key using binary search
*   Deletion of key-value pairs
*   Dynamic resizing of the data structure
