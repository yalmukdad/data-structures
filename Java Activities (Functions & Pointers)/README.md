## Features

- **Add students:** Register new students to the system.
- **Remove students:** Unregister students from the system.
- **Check registration status:** Verify if a student is already registered.
- **Count occurrences:** Determine how many times a student's name appears in the list (useful for identifying potential duplicates).
- **Print students:** Display the list of registered students.

## Files

- **`StudentManager.java`:** Contains the implementation of the `StudentManager` class, which manages the linked list of students. This class provides methods for:
    - Adding students (`addStudent`)
    - Removing students (`removeStudent`)
    - Checking registration status (`isRegistered`)
    - Counting occurrences of a student's name (`countOccurrences`)
    - Printing the list of students (`printStudents`)
- **`M02A3.java`:** Contains the `main` method and demonstrates the usage of the `StudentManager` class.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Compile:** `javac StudentManager.java M02A3.java`
3. **Run:** `java M02A3`

## Data Structures

- **Singly Linked List:** A custom singly linked list is used to manage student registrations. This provides a basic example of linked list manipulation in Java and demonstrates fundamental concepts like node creation, traversal, and modification.

## Example Operations

The `M02A3.java` file demonstrates the following operations:

- Adding students to the list.
- Removing students from the list.
- Checking if students are registered.
- Counting the occurrences of a student's name.
- Printing the list of registered students.
