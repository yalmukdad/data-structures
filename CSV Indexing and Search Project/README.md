# CSV Indexing and Search Project

This project implements a system for indexing and searching through a CSV file containing product information. It utilizes a `TreeMap` to create an index based on the primary key (product ID) for efficient searching.

## Project Structure

*   `CSVIndexManager.java`: Contains the core logic for generating, loading, and searching the index.
*   `M08FP.java`: A tester class to interact with the `CSVIndexManager` and perform searches.
*   `Products.csv`: A sample CSV file containing product data (replace with your actual data file).
*   `Products.idx`: The index file generated by the program.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure `Products.csv` is in the main project directory.
2.  Compile and run `M08FP.java`.
3.  Follow the on-screen menu to generate the index, load the index, and perform searches.

## Functionality

*   **Generate Index:** Reads the CSV file and creates an index based on the primary key (first field in each row).
*   **Load Index:** Loads the pre-generated index from a file.
*   **Linear Search:** Performs a sequential search through the CSV file.
*   **Map-Based Search:** Uses the index to perform a fast lookup.

## Performance

The map-based search, utilizing the `TreeMap` index, offers significant performance improvements over the linear search, especially for large datasets.

## Potential Improvements

*   Error handling and logging could be enhanced.
*   Performance optimizations could be explored for very large CSV files.
*   Additional features like handling duplicates, partial matches, or case-insensitive searches could be added.
